## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Set up Firebase** - Follow the [Firebase Setup Guide](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
2. **Configure environment variables** - Add Firebase config to `.env` and Netlify
3. **Deploy** - Your admin panel will be available at `/admin`

## 🔐 Accessing the Admin Panel

- **URL**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/admin` or `http://localhost:8080/admin`
- **Login**: Use the admin email and password you created in Firebase Authentication

## 📝 Managing Content

### Projects
- Add projects with title, descriptions, tech stack, images, and URLs
- Mark projects as featured
- Upload multiple images per project
- Set project status (completed/in-progress)

### Certifications
- Add certifications with issuer, issue date, and credential URL
- Upload certificate images
- Add descriptions

### Experience
- Add work experience entries
- Mark current positions
- Add responsibilities and skills used
- Set start and end dates

### Skills
- Add skills with name, category, and skill level
- Skills are automatically grouped by category on the portfolio
- Add icons (emoji or text) to skills

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Admin Panel** (`/admin`): Authenticated admin users can create, update, and delete content
2. **Portfolio Pages** (`/`): Public pages fetch and display content from Firestore
3. **Real-time Updates**: Changes in the admin panel are immediately reflected on the portfolio

## 🛡️ Security

- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication handles secure login
- **Authorization**: Only the admin email (set in `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`) can access the admin panel
- **Firestore Rules**: Public read, authenticated write
- **Storage Rules**: Public read, authenticated write

## 📚 Documentation

- [Firebase Setup Guide](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md) - Complete setup instructions
- `firestore.rules` - Firestore security rules
- `storage.rules` - Storage security rules

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

See the [Firebase Setup Guide](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for troubleshooting tips.

## 💡 Tips

- **First Time**: When you first log in, the database will be empty. Add your content through the admin panel.
- **Images**: Images are automatically uploaded to Firebase Storage and optimized.
- **Categories**: For skills, use consistent category names (e.g., "Frontend Development", "Backend & Database") for better grouping.
- **Featured Projects**: Mark your best projects as "Featured" to highlight them on the portfolio.
