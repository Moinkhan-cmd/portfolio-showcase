# 🚀 Quick Guide: Add Skills Through Admin Panel

I've created a script to automatically add all your previous skills, but you can also add them manually. Here's both options:

## Option 1: Use the Seed Script (FASTEST - 2 minutes)

I've created a script that will automatically add all your skills. Here's how to use it:

### Step 1: Install dependencies (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Run the seed script
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seedSkills.ts
```

**OR** if tsx is not available, you can compile and run it:
```bash
npm install -D tsx
npx tsx scripts/seedSkills.ts
```

That's it! All your skills will be added automatically! ✅
