# 🚀 Quick Guide: Add Your Skills Automatically

I've created a simple HTML page that will add all your previous skills to Firestore automatically!

## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Script
1. **Navigate to your project folder** in File Explorer
2. **Go to the `scripts` folder**
3. **Double-click `addSkills.html`** (it will open in your browser)

**OR** open it in VS Code, right-click, and select "Open with Live Server" or just open it in your browser.

### Step 2: Make Sure You're Authenticated
1. **First, log into your admin panel**: Go to `http://localhost:8080/admin/login` and log in
2. **Then open the `addSkills.html` file** in the same browser (same tab or new tab is fine)

### Step 3: Add the Skills
1. **Click the "Add All Skills" button** on the page
2. **Wait a few seconds** - you'll see progress messages
3. **When done**, you'll see: "✅ Successfully added 20 skills"
